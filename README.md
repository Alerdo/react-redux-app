# Weather API React App

Welcome to the Weather API React App! This project showcases my skills in building a dynamic web application that utilizes a weather API to provide real-time weather data based on user input.

## Project Overview

The Weather API React App is designed to deliver a seamless weather information experience. It employs two distinct API calls to gather and display weather data for a chosen city. These API calls serve to deliver both the current weather conditions and a 3-day forecast for the selected location.

The application is thoughtfully divided into key components:

- `App.js`: Serving as the cornerstone of the application, this component orchestrates API calls, manages data retrieval, and structures the application's core logic.

- `Search`: The intuitive search form empowers users to specify a city, triggering the retrieval of pertinent weather details. Once submitted, the form initiates the API call to fetch the current weather data for the chosen city.

- `Main`: With a focus on user experience, the `Main` component presents the current weather conditions for the specified city. Additionally, it hosts a nested `Week` component to offer a comprehensive weather forecast for the upcoming week.

- `Aside`: Going above and beyond, the `Aside` component adds an extra layer of intrigue by showcasing diverse, random weather-related facts. This section enriches the main weather data display, creating a well-rounded user experience.

## How to Experience the App

1. Clone this repository onto your local machine.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
4. Sign up with a weather API provider and secure an API key.
5. Within the `App.js` file, replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the obtained API key.
6. Launch the app using this command:
7. Access the application through your web browser by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
8. Enter the desired city in the search form and submit to access the weather data.
